# Persistent Benedict Cumberbot
A script that sends mutations of Benedict Cumberbatch to a list of emails.  Done in half an hour with some less than ideal coding habits that I'm too lazy to fix right now.

## Why
Because.

## Future Goals
This repository might be a good place to experiment with some Python libraries and other technologies.  An idea in the works is to play with AWS and have a cron job send out messages daily to emails in a database.
